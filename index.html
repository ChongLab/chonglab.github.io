                <p>X. Shirley Liu received a Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics and a Ph.D. minor in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2002.
                    She is a Professor with the Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard School of Public Health.
                    Shirley is a computational biologist with expertise in cancer epigenetics.
                    Her research focuses on algorithm development and integrative mining from big data generated on microarrays, massively parallel sequencing, and other high-throughput techniques to model the specificity and function of transcription factors, chromatin regulators and lncRNAs in tumor development, progression, drug response and resistance.
